		<h1>Privacy</h1>

		<h2 class='version'>Version 1.4 of the Privacy policy, as published on 12 January, 2015.</h2>

		<!-- Note: there are two links to the history, below. The first leads to the original repository and the second to the new one. -->

		<p>Our privacy policy is simple (and will stay that way). If we make any changes, we will let you know through <a href='/about/contact/#newsletter'>the Ind.ie newsletter</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/indie'>Twitter feed</a>. As <a href='https://ind.ie'>this web site</a> is open source (and all of its content released under a Creative Commons Attribution License), you can also see <a href='https://source.ind.ie/project/ind-ie/commits/master/source/privacy/index.html'>a history</a> <a href='https://source.ind.ie/project/ind-ie-site/commits/master/source/about/privacy/index.html'>of all changes</a> with the differences highlighted so that you can quickly see what changed and when.</p>

		<h2>In general</h2>

		<p>We try our best to minimise the data we gather. We use self-hosted free and open tools whenever possible and we do not share your data with third parties.</p>

		<h2>Newsletter</h2>

		<p>We manage the newsletter using <a href='https://sendy.co'>Sendy</a>, hosted on our own virtual server on <a href='https://www.digitalocean.com/'>Digital Ocean</a>.

		<p>When you sign up for our mailing list, we’re the only ones who see your email address. We will never share it with anyone else and we will use it to send you news and updates about Ind.ie until you unsubscribe.</p>

		<h2>Videos</h2>

		<p>MP4 and Flash formatted videos are hosted on Vimeo using <a href='/blog/accessible-video-player/'>our own custom video player</a>.</p>

		<h2>Analytics</h2>

		<p>We use our own hosted version of <a href='http://piwik.org'>Piwik</a>, an open source analytics package. We use this data to see how popular Ind.ie is, and which parts of the web site are most visited.</p>
