			<h3 class='centre-title'>An open letter to Tim Cook.</h3>
			<p>Dear Tim,</p>
			<p>I enjoyed watching your <a href='http://www.charlierose.com/watch/60444569' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>interview with Charlie Rose</span></a> last month where you said “you’re not our product”. That’s why I still use a Mac, iPhone, and iPad as stopgaps instead of Google’s spyware until we have our own platform and the <a href='/phone/' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>Indie Phone</span></a>. And that’s why we’re releasing <a href='https://ind.ie' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>Heartbeat</span></a> first on Yosemite.</p>
			<p>However, there is one area where you are falling behind Google, and that’s in openness.</p>
			<p>Just as your customers should not be your product, your developers should not be your prisoners.</p>
			<p>Swift is a beautiful language but you want to keep it all to yourself. That’s just not on.</p>
			<p>Imagine how different Apple’s own story would have been if <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>Richard</span></a> had not written the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>GNU C Compiler</span></a> and released it under a free license. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>Steve</span></a> could not have had an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>Objective-C</span></a> compiler built on top of it at <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>NeXT</span></a>. Or what if <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>Chris</span></a> had not released <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>LLVM</span></a> under an open license?</p>
			<p>Now you’re releasing the heir to Objective-C, but you seem to have forgotten the legacy that got you to where you are.</p>
			<p>I know you must see <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_%28programming_language%29' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>Swift</span></a>, like <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_%28iOS_API%29' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>Metal</span></a>, as a way to make it harder for developers to port their apps to Android, and therefore be forced to make a decision between the two platforms. These moves will, no doubt, gain iOS more exclusive titles. But only those who lack confidence in their ability to otherwise compete resort to lock-in as a competitive advantage. You don’t need this. You’re better than this.</p>
			<p>You stand today against Google where you stood a decade ago against Microsoft. They may look unstoppable now, but just as you rode the user experience wave past Microsoft, you can ride the upcoming privacy wave past Google. Your business model is your greatest competitive advantage. You, like us, can compete <a href='http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2014/09/30/the-next-big-thing-is-privacy/' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>by coming up with a thing that people want, that you do, and your competitors can’t do</span></a> because their business model won’t let them. I’m pretty sure you understand all this already.</p>
			<p>So please don’t make generations of developers pay for a momentary loss of confidence at Apple.</p>
			<p>Have the confidence to release Swift under a free and open license. Let it become like the giants on whose shoulders Apple got to where it is today. And compete on Apple’s core strengths: user experience and, now, privacy.</p>
			<p>Today, we’re announcing Phoenix to give you a friendly nudge. It’s what friends do when they notice someone they care about making a mistake.</p>
			<p>We hope Apple does the right thing and release Swift under a free and open license so we can contribute to that instead of needlessly duplicating effort building our own version.</p>
			<p>So, what do you say?</p>
			<p>Will you do the right thing and release Swift under a free and open license?</p>
			<p>In my heart, I know you want to. Please have the confidence to make the right choice.</p>
			<p>Your friend,<br/>
			Aral</p>
			<h2 class='centre-title'>What is Phoenix?</h2>
			<p>Phoenix is a free and open version of Apple’s Swift programming language. It is being developed by Greg Casamento, the newest member of the Ind.ie team. Greg brings years of experience in Objective-C and compiler development to Ind.ie and also leads the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNUstep' class='subtle-link'><span class='subtle-link'>GNUStep</span></a> project.</p>
