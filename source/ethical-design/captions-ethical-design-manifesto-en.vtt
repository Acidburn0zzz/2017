00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Take Maslow’s hierarchy of needs 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and you apply it to design in an ethical manner

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
so at its base, at its very base

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we need to build things that are decentralised

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
private, open, and interoperable

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
accessible, so not just fitting the needs of

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
able-bodied white men

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Right?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Diversity is so important in what we do

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If we do not have diversity in these communities

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that are tackling this problem

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
then we have already lost

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The only way to design solutions

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
for a diverse audience, for a diverse

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
citizenship, is to have

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.769
diverse groups designing for themselves

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:39.187
Not studying another group

00:00:39.187 --> 00:00:41.964
not studying the other, not being colonialist

00:00:42.123 --> 00:00:43.964
in their approach, but having

00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:46.279
diverse groups that design for themselves

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.279
diversity is not a charity

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:52.398
diversity is competitive advantage

00:00:52.398 --> 00:00:56.573
it is one that we need to start taking advantage of

00:00:56.573 --> 00:00:59.855
So, we build things that respect human rights

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:01.855
but we don’t stop there

00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:04.767
then we go on, we build things that are functional

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:06.767
and convenient and reliable

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:09.600
because, again, it’s about respect

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.861
this time it’s about respecting human effort

00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:14.861
but we don’t stop there

00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:19.326
we build things that are delightful

00:01:19.326 --> 00:01:23.502
because that is about respecting human experience

00:01:23.502 --> 00:01:26.067
and that’s very important, that’s what we overlook

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:29.090
in the Free and Open Source world a lot of the time

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.965
We have to respect human experience as well

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:35.617
if you think about it, experiences are all we have in life

00:01:35.617 --> 00:01:36.830
and then we die

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.123
Whether those are experiences with people

00:01:39.123 --> 00:01:40.499
or with objects

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.061
they are like the grains of sand in the

00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:44.061
hourglass of your life

00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:47.014
each one of them deserves respect

00:01:47.014 --> 00:01:49.562
our respect, and it’s a huge responsibility

00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:52.889
on the part of those of us who are building these solutions

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:56.088
to respect the experiences, to respect those grains of sand

00:01:56.088 --> 00:02:00.016
to respect the lives of the people we are building for

00:02:00.016 --> 00:02:03.408
and this is where we fail though, at the very beginning,

00:02:03.408 --> 00:02:07.074
in mainstream technology that is where we fail

00:02:07.074 --> 00:02:10.062
because we’re building things that do not respect human rights

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:13.082
and when you do that, you’re not building things

00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:15.768
for people, you’re building things on the backs

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.768
of people

00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:20.815
So that’s the Ethical Design Manifesto

00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:23.472
We released it at the end of last year

00:02:23.472 --> 00:02:26.206
and my little wins every day

00:02:26.206 --> 00:02:28.206
are getting things like this:

00:02:28.206 --> 00:02:30.823
pictures showing a design firm

00:02:30.823 --> 00:02:34.041
where someone’s printed it out and actually remixed their own copy

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:36.041
because they didn’t like that mine was all grey

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:39.708
and they said let’s remix it, put some colours in there

00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:42.828
And hearing from them, that this has helped them

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:45.608
when they were negotiating a project with a client

00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:48.709
it helped the person at this agency

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.709
to not work on a project

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.709
they went to their boss and said "Look…

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.793
it violates that, and I’m not happy working on this

00:02:55.793 --> 00:02:57.793
project that we have as a client agency"

00:02:57.793 --> 00:03:01.116
Which takes, you know, a spine, it really does

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:04.424
Seeing these put up in different agencies

00:03:04.424 --> 00:03:06.559
around the world is just lovely

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:09.418
I think this is from Philips in Amsterdam…

00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:13.186
I got an email from two researchers who said

00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:16.806
"we want to use this as a basis for a talk

00:03:16.806 --> 00:03:19.487
that we want to give, a paper that we want to write"

00:03:19.487 --> 00:03:23.374
saying "it made us reflect on the methods and practices

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.834
we use within the Human Computer Interaction community

00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:28.834
and how can we translate that?"

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:31.530
Just yesterday, on Twitter, I got this:

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.339
Clemens Schuster from the consultancy Hofrat Suess

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.947
"Thanks once again for putting forward the ethical design manifesto

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:41.144
it was so helpful today within a discussion with a

00:03:41.144 --> 00:03:43.991
high policy maker at EU in Brussels"

00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:46.742
We need these simple, easy-to-understand

00:03:46.742 --> 00:03:50.901
accessible frameworks in order to make the case

00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:54.736
At its core, the issues we’re talking about are not complex

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:57.898
they’re very simple, they come back to basics,

00:03:57.898 --> 00:04:00.186
the very basics of philosophy, before it was made into

00:04:00.186 --> 00:04:01.509
an academic pursuit

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:03.925
How shall we live? What is good?

00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:05.262
These are very basic things,

00:04:05.262 --> 00:04:07.262
What are the rights of a person?
