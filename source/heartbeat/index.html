		<p>Heartbeat is a social network client that is private by default. It’s peer-to-peer and uses a distributed synchronisation engine called Pulse. You can use Heartbeat to share your thoughts, photos, or anything else privately across all your devices. You can also share privately with your friends, or publish publicly for the whole world to see via the Web.</p>

		<p>You have full ownership and control.</p>

		<p>Heartbeat is free as in freedom.</p>

		<p>And it’s a beautiful, simple experience.</p>

		<p>Heartbeat enters private pre-alpha in January 2015, with a limited release on OS X Yosemite.</p>
