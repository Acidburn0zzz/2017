        <p>
        This release contains a couple of small updates to the user experience. This includes notifications of new devices attempting to connect, 
        notifications of known devices attempting to share a new folder and we are moving the default configured folder from <code>~/Sync</code> to <code>~/pulse/Sync</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Previous to this release, creating a connection between two peers involved both parties manually filling out the <code>Add Device</code> menu form.
        Both parties had to identify one another with a device ID and an optional device name, along with some other configuration options. Pulse will now show a notification
        when a request to pair is received. The notification contains the device ID of the requesting device, along with the option to <code>Grant</code> or
        <code>Ignore</code> the request. Granting the request adds the device to your own list of devices, with the default device pairing configuration settings.
        The device can then be edited/updated via the <code>edit</code> button on the device tab.
        </p>

        <p>
        Similarly, a notification is now triggered when a device attempts to share a folder ID with your device, that hasn't already been configured. This notification asks 
        the user to either <code>Add Folder</code> or <code>Ignore</code>. In this case <code>Add Folder</code> opens the <code>Add Device</code> dialog with the folder ID and 
        a suggested folder location within the <code>~/pulse/</code> directory. It also defaults to share the folder back to the requesting device.
        </p>

        <p>
        Currently, ignoring devices and folders isn't relayed back to the requesting device. So restarting Pulse can lead to previously ignored notifications appearing again.
        This is down to the current communication protocols and configuration of Pulse devices.
        Going forward we expect we will be reviewing and changing the protocols used between Pulse devices, in order to achieve our desired user experience.
        Just so that you know we are aware of this problem and that we are investigating solutions.
