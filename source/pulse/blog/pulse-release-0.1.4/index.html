        <p>
        Just a quick post describing the latest pulse release. This release contains lots of upstream changes from the Syncthing project (specifically
        up to their 0.10.11 release).
        This also marks a move to the Go 1.4 compiler. Most of the changes involved in this release are for maintenance and refactoring purposes.
        Although there are some noticeable visual changes. For example, devices and folder tab bars are now gray and the text changes colour instead.
        We have decided to remove some icons and add some new ones to the folder and device headers.
