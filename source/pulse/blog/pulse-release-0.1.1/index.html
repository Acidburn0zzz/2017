        Just a quick update to tell you all about a release that is about to take place (0.1.1). Pulse will automatically upgrade itself soon, if not already.
        Unless otherwise specified within the settings panel (cog icon in the top right).
        </p>
        <p>
        This release is in response to an issue with communication between Pulse instances and Syncthing instances. The TLS configuration signs its host
        as <em>pulse</em> on a Pulse device and <em>syncthing</em> on a Syncthing device. To retain the ability to communicate with Syncthing devices, release
        0.1.1 will set hosts in certs to <em>syncthing</em> by default on Pulse set up. As well as allowing certs with a host <em>pulse</em> that have been created, to still
        be supported by Pulse 0.1.0+ clients.
        </p>
        <p>
        For users of Pulse 0.1.0, that want to connect with a Syncthing device, regeneration of your configuration certificates will be required until we
        come to a shared solution with the Syncthing community. In order to do this we recommend you upgrade to 0.1.1, delete the <code>cert.pem</code> and <code>key.pem</code>
        from your Pulse configuration folder. Then restart. Be aware this will generate you a <b>new Device ID</b>.
        Default configuration file locations are as follows. Please try <code>~/.config</code> if you have no success with <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> on Linux.
        </p>

            <li>Linux: <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pulse/</code></li>
            <li>Linux: <code>~/.config/pulse/</code></li>
