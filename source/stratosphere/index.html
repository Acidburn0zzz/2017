		<h1 class='time-to-move-beyond-the-clouds'>It’s time to move <strong>beyond the clouds.</strong></h1>

		<p>Clouds are centralised. They’re owned and controlled by someone else. And they can spy on you.</p>

		<p>We are building a new post-cloud platform where <em>you</em> are the network.</p>

		<p>It’s called the Indienet.</p>

		<p>The Indienet is a peer-to-peer social network that sits on top of the Internet and overlaps with the Web.</p>

		<h2>Project Stratosphere</h2>

		<p>Project Stratosphere is a multi-year project that will culminate in the release of <a href='/phone'>an independent smartphone</a>.</p>

		<p>It’s not an all-or-nothing moonshot.</p>

		<p>We are not waiting for the phone to be released to launch the network and the ecosystem. And yet every decision we take in the design and development of the network and the ecosystem takes the design of the phone into consideration.</p>

		<p>We’re starting this year and when the phone is ready it will simply be the best way to participate in an already-thriving Indienet.</p>

		<img src='images/indie-net-and-heartbeat.png' alt='The Indienet and Heartbeat: a peer-to-peer network without peer.' class='indie-net-and-heartbeat'>

		<h3>A network with a heart</h3>

		<p>We are building the Indienet on three core technologies: <a href='/pulse'>Pulse</a>, <a href='/heartbeat'>Heartbeat</a>, and <a href='/waystone'>Waystone</a>.</p>

		<p><a href='/pulse'>Pulse</a> is available today. It is a low-level distributed file synchronisation service that you can use to replace Dropbox with if you’re a technically-savvy user. You can also use it as a black box to build other distributes services on top of or alongside.</p>

		<p>On top of Pulse, we are building the Indienet browser, <a href='/heartbeat'>Heartbeat</a>.</p>

		<p>Be one of the first to test Heartbeat by supporting us at the Independence and Democracy tiers at our <a href='/'>crowdfunding</a>.</p>

		<p>Heartbeat is a social network client that is private by default. Use Heartbeat to share your thoughts, photos, or anything else privately across all your devices. You can also share privately with your friends, or publish publicly for the whole world to see via the Web.</p>

		<p>Heartbeat will enter private pre-alpha on Human Rights Day, December 10th, 2014, with a limited release on OS X Yosemite.</p>

		<p>Ind.ie itself will start running Waystone when the Indienet goes public.</p>

		<p>Think of Waystone as a pub that you go to to meet friends. Once you’ve met and exchanged numbers, you’re in touch directly and don’t need to stay at the pub to communicate.</p>

		<h3>The long road to freedom</h3>

		<p>We’re just getting started.</p>

		<p>Together, we can build a future where we have independent alternatives to the <a href='https://aralbalkan.com/notes/spyware-2.0'>spyware</a> of companies like Google and Facebook.</p>

		<h3>Support us</h3>

		<p>You can help give us the push we need to make rapid progress on Pulse, Heartbeat, and Waystone in 2015.</p>
