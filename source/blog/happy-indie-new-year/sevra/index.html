    <h2>Sevra Davis’ statement of support</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I’m writing in support of Aral Balkan and his application to Shuttleworth for Heartbeat, the de-centralised, private-by-design social network he’s building with Ind.ie.</p>
 
      <p>I have known Aral for approximately two years when, in doing some research on innovative people and projects using design, I came across his work. I consequently invited him to speak at my organisation,The <a href='https://www.thersa.org/'>RSA</a> (The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) and his public talk in April 2014 titled ‘<a href='https://www.thersa.org/events/2014/04/free-is-a-lie/'>Free is Lie</a>’ was one of our most popular ever and continues to be viewed online. The RSA is a 261-year old not-for-profit organisation whose mission is to create the conditions for the enlightened thinking and collaborative action needed to address today's most pressing social challenges. We serve this mission by acting as a global hub, by enabling millions of people to access the most creative ideas, by nurturing networks of innovators, and through researching, testing and sharing practical interventions.</p>
 
      <p>Aral is a key innovator within our network and his work with Ind.ie and Heartbeat are exactly the kind of practical interventions that the RSA supports and believes in. Aral and Heartbeat’s commitment to the power of good design in making things accessible to everyday people is truly admirable and will continue to set him and Heartbeat apart.</p>
 
      <p>Since meeting and his talk at the RSA, Aral has become a <a href='https://www.thersa.org/fellowship/what-is-fellowship/'>Fellow of the RSA</a> and has also been a supporter and ‘critical friend’ to my work at the RSA, namely the <a href='http://sda.thersa.org/'>RSA Student Design Awards</a>. The RSA Student Design Awards is a global curriculum and competition that challenges emerging designers to apply their skills to today’s most pressing challenges.</p>
 
      <p>On a personal note, I would like to add that Aral is one of the most approachable and open people I’ve met in my career and I believe that he approaches his work and life with open-mindedness, thoughtfulness, care and optimism.</p>
