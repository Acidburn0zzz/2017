  <p>Hey folks,</p>

  <p>I’m delighted to announce that Indie Phone has been nominated for <a href='https://thenetawards.com/vote/game-changer/indiephone/'>Game Changer of the Year</a> at <a href='http://thenetawards.com/'>The Net Awards</a>.

  <p>Also, my talk <a href='https://thenetawards.com/vote/talk/aral-balkan-digital-feudalism-a/'>Digital Feudalism and How to Avoid It</a> has been nominated for <a href='https://thenetawards.com/vote/talk/aral-balkan-digital-feudalism-a/'>Conference Talk of the Year</a> and I’ve personally been nominated for <a href='https://thenetawards.com/vote/entrepreneur/aral-balkan/'>Entrepreneur of the Year</a>.</p>

  <p>A win in any of the categories will draw greater attention to what we’re trying to achieve with Indie Phone and indie technologies in general and I would very much appreciate your support.</p>

  <p>Public voting is now open and your votes will help determine the finalists.</p>

  <p>You can vote via the direct links below:</p>

  <p>Thank you all for your love and support. It really means a lot. Together, we are making a change and helping build alternative technologies that empower everyday individuals to own their own data and tools. I firmly believe that these alternatives are essential if we are to continue to enjoy our right to privacy and freedom of expression and, subsequently, the other civil liberties and human rights for which they are prerequisites.</p>

  <p>Here’s to making 2014 the year that indie technologies hit the limelight.</p>

      <p>All the best,</p>
