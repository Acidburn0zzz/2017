      <p>Hi everyone,</p>

      <p>Laura and I have spent the last eight months working on a new app that we’re excited to release today. It’s called <a href='https://better.fyi'>Better</a> and it’s a content blocker for iPhone and iPad.</p>

      <p>Better is <em>not</em> an ad blocker.</p>

      <p>The problem isn’t advertising; it’s <em>behavioural</em> advertising.</p>

      <h3>The problem is tracking.</h3>

      <figure>
        <img src='images/violations.jpg' alt='Screenshot from Better showing 172 trackers, clickbait and web bugs'>
        <figcaption><p>Better protects you from trackers, clickbait, and other similar web malware. The statistics here are from just one site, LifeBuzz.com, which is possibly <a href='https://better.fyi/sites/lifebuzz.com/'>the worst site on the web</a>).</p></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Better is a tracker blocker. It is a web malware blocker. Our goal is to make the web safer, lighter, and faster in line with the principles of <a href='/ethical-design'>ethical design</a>.</p>

      <p>Better is <a href='https://source.ind.ie/better'>free as in freedom</a>, <a href='https://source.ind.ie/better/content'>transparent</a>, and <a href='https://forum.ind.ie/c/better'>open</a>.</p>

      <p>Better isn’t yet another indecipherable list of blocking rules cobbled together from various sources. It’s <a href='https://better.fyi/trackers/outbrain.com'>encyclopaedia-style entries</a> on <a href='https://better.fyi/trackers'>trackers</a> and <a href='https://better.fyi/spotlight'>editorial spotlights</a>. We research and document trackers to create an educational resource and raise public awareness. That resource, <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/better-by-ind.ie/id1080964978?mt=8'>via the iPhone and iPad app</a>, becomes a tool to protect ourselves from tracking.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src='images/improvements.jpg' alt='Screenshot from Better showing the site is 16.9x safer, 4.0x lighter, and 15.8x faster'>

      <h3>Does the world need yet another content blocker?</h3>

      <p>We feel that it does: <em>a principled one.</em></p>

      <p>One that works for <em>you</em>, <a href='http://venturebeat.com/2012/07/31/ghostery-a-web-tracking-blocker-that-actually-helps-the-ad-industry/'>not for the advertising industry</a>.</p>

      <p>One that cannot <a href='https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/02/04/google-amazon-microsoft-pay-to-get-ads-past-adblock-plus/'>be bought</a>.</p>

      <p>One that exposes <a href='https://better.fyi/sites/lifebuzz.com/'>the ridiculous human costs of surveillance capitalism</a>.</p>

      <p>One that <a href='https://better.fyi/spotlight/iab.com'>doesn’t make toxic deals</a> with the <a href='https://better.fyi/spotlight/iab.com'>behavioural advertising industry</a>.</p>

      <p>One that <a href='https://better.fyi/spotlight/wired.com'>fights back</a> when our ability to defend ourselves is threatened.</p>

      <p>One that acknowledges and supports <a href='https://better.fyi/spotlight/decknetwork.net'>those who are trying to do the right thing.</a></p>

      <h3>Let’s make the web better.</h3>

      <p>Better is different, because <em>we</em> are different.</p>

      <p>We do not work for the advertising industry. We work for <em>you</em>.</p>

      <p>We are <a href='/team'>a two-person-and-one-husky social enterprise</a> working for social justice in the digital age.</p>

      <p>Our business model is simple: <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/better-by-ind.ie/id1080964978?mt=8'>we sell Better on the App Store</a>. If enough people buy it, we subsist and continue to work on Better and <a href='/heartbeat/'>Heartbeat</a>.</p>

      <p>The launch of Better marks a new chapter in the history of <a href='/'>Ind.ie</a>. After two years, it is our first product available to the general public. It is also our hope for reaching sustainability.</p>

      <p>We appreciate your support and continued friendship.</p>

      <p>Thank you for helping us make the web better.</p>

      <p class='with-love'>With love,</p>

      <p>Aral and Laura</p>

      <p class='ps'>PS. Please tell your friends about Better – we need all the help we can get to spread the word! :)</p>
