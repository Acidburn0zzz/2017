            <h2>Video: Aral speaks at the European Parliament</h2>

            <p>A couple of weeks ago, Aral spoke on a panel at the European Parliament on “Internet As A Commons: The Big Picture.” We’ve edited the event video so you can watch <a href='/internet-as-a-commons'>Aral’s introduction, closing, and panel questions</a>.</p>

            <p>You can also <a href='http://greenmediabox.eu/en/ct/107-Internet-as-a-Commons-Public-Space-in-the-Digital-Age'>watch the full video on the Greens’ live event site</a>.</p>

            <h2>Heartbeat in the Knight News Challenge</h2>

            <p>This year <a href='https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/data/entries/heartbeat-privately-social'>we’ve again entered into the Knight News Challenge</a>. We didn’t win anything last year. This year, we’re hoping that with a tighter focus on Heartbeat we have a better chance at getting funds.</p>

            <p><a href='https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/data/entries/heartbeat-privately-social'>Please give us your “applause” and comments on our page</a>. It’s not a popularity contest, so more applause doesn’t mean that we’re more likely to win funding. (Although applause will increase our visibility on their site.)</p>

            <p>Leaving comments on what Heartbeat means to you can help Knight and their partners see the potential in our work. As you may know, <a href='https://forum.ind.ie/t/young-broke-and-beautiful-thoughts-on-ind-ie-s-path-to-sustainability/874'>we’re young, broke, and beautiful</a>, so any funds at this point will help us get us to sustainability.</p>

            <h2>Further funding</h2>

            We’re spending a lot of time looking at funding and sustainability, and have also added an option for people to <a href='/fund'>donate recurring funds to us each month</a>. These funds will help us keep the lights on, hire more developers, advocate at important events, and continue to work on Heartbeat. You can find out more on <a href='/fund'>our funding page</a>.</p>

            <p>So far, the recurring donations of our current patrons almost cover our basic hosting bill every month. <strong>Thank you so much to all of you for supporting our work.</strong></p>
