      <h2>About Rafael and Open-Xchange</h2>
      <p>I got the chance to spend time both on stage and off with Rafael in Munich recently, during the Open-Xchange Summit, where I presented the opening keynote <a href='https://vimeo.com/106681730'>I, Simulation</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to running a successful open source business, Rafael is a fellow campainger for privacy and human rights.
