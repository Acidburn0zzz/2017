      <p>Ind.ie has a very simple goal: to create alternative technologies that protect our fundamental freedoms, human rights, and democracy.</p>
      <p>To do this, we are creating a new platform where you, as an individual, have ownership and control of your tools and information.</p>
      <p>Today, it’s my pleasure to introduce you to one of the core technologies of this platform and to welcome the community around it into the Ind.ie family.</p>
      <h2>Ind.ie Pulse</h2>
      <p><a href='https://ind.ie/pulse'>Pulse</a> (previously <a href='http://syncthing.net'>Syncthing</a>) is a distributed file synchronisation engine built with simplicity and usability in mind. It was created by Jakob Borg and is currently being developed with the help of community contributors.</p>
      <p>Ind.ie uses Pulse as the core of Heartbeat.</p>
      <p>Ind.ie is taking on the stewardship of Pulse. It is our goal to help support it as it grows independently of Heartbeat. Pulse will remain a separate product. We will contribute resources to support continued work on the project. We will also help by working on the user experience of the product.</p>
      <p>As part of the process, Pulse has also moved to a GNU GPLv3 (or later) license. This means that it is now impossible for anyone to close it off later. It is now free as in freedom.</p>
      <p>Also, I’m hugely excited to announce that Jakob is joining the Ind.ie advisory committee. We have so much to learn from him and I greatly appreciate his friendship and support.</p>
      <p>Jakob has written <a href='https://discourse.syncthing.net/t/introducing-pulse-and-ind-ie/1074'>a post to introduce Pulse</a> and I highly recommend that you read it. Just to make it clear, as Jakob states in his post: “No money has changed hands and there are no hidden agendas or benefits here.”</p>
      <p>We are slowly transitioning the <a href='http://syncthing.net'>Syncthing website</a> over to Ind.ie. Both sites will remain up for this week and we plan on completing the transition of the site and forums next week.</p>
      <p>I’m hugely excited to have Jakob on our advisory committee and to welcome Pulse into the Ind.ie family.</p>
      <p>Here’s to the first concrete step towards freedom.</p>
      <p>With love,</p>
      <p>Aral</p>
