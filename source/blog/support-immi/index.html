      <p class='summary'>The Icelandic Pirates want to create a data safe haven and <a href='https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/switzerland-of-bits--4#/story'>they need your support</a>.</p>

      <h2>Indies need IMMI</h2>

      <p>Last year, <a href='https://ar.al/notes/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/'>we were looking for a new place to live and a new home for Ind.ie</a>. With the looming <a href='http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2016-01/29/technology-ip-bill-surveillance-committee'>Snoopers’ Charter</a> (Investigatory Powers Bill), the UK was no longer a tenable option for a tiny organisation building technology to protect human rights.</p>

      <p>In our search for a safe place for Ind.ie, <a href='/blog/happy-indie-new-year/'>we visited Iceland</a>. There, we met with Birgitta and Gaui from <a href='https://en.immi.is'>IMMI</a> (International Modern Media Institute) who briefed us on their ongoing work to establish the best legislation for freedom of expression, freedom of speech, and freedom of information in Iceland, that would “reflect the realities of the borderless world.”</p>

      <h2>What’s IMMI?</h2>

      <p>IMMI is a tiny fully-independent non-profit organisation founded in 2011 after the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative (IMMI’s namesake) was adopted unanimously in the Icelandic Parliament. The goal of the initiative is to make Iceland a journalistic safe haven. It aims to create new standards that can be adopted around the world. IMMI was founded to ensure the drafting process for this legislation would be transparent and successful. IMMI seeks ways to enhance and empower freedom of expression, speech, and information, dissemination of information and publication, as well as ensuring source protection and whistleblower protection.</p>

      <p>IMMI is the key to a safe and democratic society. For us at Ind.ie, their data protection legislation and virtual company structure is invaluable. It will help us preserve the privacy of the people using our products, and prevent governments from coercing us to add backdoors or shutting us down. IMMI is the anti-Snoopers’ Charter.</p>

      <h2>IMMI needs our help!</h2>

      <p>IMMI has just started an <a href='https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/switzerland-of-bits--4#/'>Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign</a> to cover their running costs. Titled “Switzerland of Bits,” the campaign will also enable them to achieve even more over the next six months. You can <a href='https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/switzerland-of-bits--4#/'>help by donating as little as $5 USD</a>, and play an important role in creating a historic precedent with huge positive impact on global freedom and democracy.</p>

      <p>With love,</p>

      <p>Laura and Aral</p>
