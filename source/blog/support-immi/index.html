      <p>Last year, you may have read that <a href='https://ar.al/notes/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/'>we were looking for a new place to live and a new home for Ind.ie</a>. With the looming <a href='http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2016-01/29/technology-ip-bill-surveillance-committee'>Snoopers’ Charter</a> (Investigatory Powers Bill), the UK was no longer a tenable option for a tiny organisation building technology to protect human rights.</p>

      <p>In our search for a safe place for Ind.ie, <a href='/blog/happy-indie-new-year/'>we visited Iceland. We met with Birgitta and Gaui from <a href='https://en.immi.is'>IMMI</a> (Icelandic Modern Media Institute) and heard about their ongoing work to establish the best legislation for freedom of expression, freedom of speech, and freedom of information in Iceland, that would “reflect the realities of the borderless world.”</p>

      <p>IMMI is a tiny fully-indepedent non-profit organisation founded in 2011 after the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative (IMMI’s namesake) was adopted unanimously in the Icelandic Parliament. The initiative aims to make Iceland a journalistic safe haven, and create new standards that could be adopted around the world. IMMI was founded to ensure the drafting process for this legislation would be both transparent and successful, and to seek ways that will enhance and empower freedom of expression, speech, and information, dissemination of information and publication, as well as ensuring source protection and whistleblower protection.</p>

      <p>All of IMMI’s focuses are key to a safe and democratic society. For us at Ind.ie, their data protection legislation and virtual company structure would help us preserve the privacy of the people using our products, and prevent governments from shutting us down, or putting backdoors into our products. It’s the anti-Snoopers’ Charter.</p>

      <h2>IMMI needs our help!</h2>

      <p>And IMMI needs our help. They’re running an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, titled “Switzerland of Bits,” to cover their running costs and help them achieve even more over the next six months. You can donate as little as $5 USD, and you can help create a world-leading standard that will have a huge impact on your, and Ind.ie’s, future.</p>

      <p>With love,</p>

      <p>Laura and Aral</p>
