      <p class='intro'>This week, the Ind.ie team has been at Re:publica in Berlin. It’s been a great event, full of interesting discussions around privacy, corporate surveillance (and a whole lot of other stuff too!) For our re:publica special, I’m going to share some of our favourite talks from the week.</p>

      <h2>Corporate surveillance</h2>

      <h3>You are the product</h3>

      <p>Aral has extended his recent talk into his latest talk, <a href='https://youtu.be/jh8supIUj6c'>You Are The Product</a>. Find out more about corporate surveillance, how you are the product, and how we need to climb out of the bullshit tree.</p>

      <h3>Corporate surveillance, tracking, big data, the Internet of Things and our digital profiles</h3>

      <p>Wolfie Christl gave <a href='https://youtu.be/8hK3VnlMpR4'>a fascinating talk that backed up a lot of the points made by Aral</a>, going into great depth on how corporations use your data, and the data brokers that extract the value from your profiles, statuses and other online information.</p>

      <p><a href='https://youtu.be/XfQqNF6kqig'>Katarzyna Szymielewicz expanded on Wolfie’s points</a>, looking further into how our information can be used against us. Katarzyna makes it clear that we only have the illusion of choice in opting in to corporate surveillance, as without the so-called benefits, we are discriminated against by companies such as insurers and lenders.</p>

      <h3>Fighting that Terminator in our Pockets</h3>

      <p>Jérémie Zimmerman gave <a href='https://youtu.be/rHdCo9w7bT4'>a fun talk comparing our scenario entrenched in government and corporate surveillance with the first Terminator film</a>. Which was coincidentally released in 1984!</p>

      <!--<h3>Demystifying the algorithm: who designs your life?</h3>

      <p>Our friend Hans De Zwart, from Bits Of Freedom, gave a fantastic talk about how algorithms aren’t designed as neutral. For example, did you know that rich residents of Hollywood successfully lobbied Google so that tourists looking for directions to the Hollywood sign on Google Maps were instead directed to a viewing platform further away? Hans’ talk points out how we often blindly assume that these products and services are designed to give us the most convenience, but instead we are treated like fools and manipulated by algorithms that aren’t designed with altruism in mind.</p>-->

      <!--<h3>Blurry line between private service and public infrastructure</h3>

      <p>Michał Woźniak put forward that private service is not the same as public infrastructure, providing evidence on how treating private services like public infrastructure has hindered privacy and security. For example, treating Google as a public infrastructure forgets that Google has corporate interests, and will happily take down apps that could benefit the privacy of a downloader at the request of a <abbr title='Telecommunications Company'>telco</abbr>:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>“As of May 2013, Google Play forbids AT&amp;T users <em>from downloading Open Garden</em>, a wireless mesh network platform, which it lists as “incompatible” at the request of the carrier.”</p>
      </blockquote>-->

      <h2>Mass surveillance by governments and corporations in Europe</h2>

      <h3>Finding a European way on Internet governance</h3>

      <p><a href='https://youtu.be/HGNixzAA5Og'>This panel on Internet governance</a> (governance of Internet security, data protection and privacy, net neutrality and more…) may start out a little dry, but it gets good really quickly. With Raegan MacDonald of Access, and Amelia Andersdotter of the Pirate Party, taking the European Commission to task on issues such as their approach to human rights in a digital age, and the nonsense that is multistakeholderism.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>“The most constructive thing the European Commission can do is listen to the people who are trying to make themselves heard.” <em>— Amelia Andersdotter, Pirate Party</em></p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>The Five Eyes secret European allies</h3>

      <p>Did you sign up to be a part of <a href='https://privacyinternational.org/?q=illegalspying'>Privacy International’s campaign against government surveillance</a>?. In this <a href='https://youtu.be/h8FBGvfGh80'>talk from Privacy International’s Deputy Director</a>, Eric King, he explains why they’re investigating, and litigating against, corporate surveillance, and how European intelligence agenices share their data and co-operate with the infamous <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes'>Five Eyes alliance</a> of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>

      <h3>A Deeper Frontier of Freedom — The State of the Deepweb</h3>

      <p>XXXXX</p>

      <h2>Reforming the system</h2>

      <p>Many of the talks concluded that the only way to change mass surveillance and corporate surveillance is to reform the systems they rely upon. Democracy must be more democratic, and, as <a href='https://youtu.be/jh8supIUj6c'>Aral said in his talk</a>, we can’t just fix the existing system, we need to build a new one.</p>

      <h3>The system is broken, and that’s the good news</h3>

      <p><a href='https://youtu.be/CJAJ8CNAT3A'>Ethan Zuckerman opened re:publica</a> talking about our political systems, how they’re broken, but how we can turn the resulting mistrust into an asset to force change.</p>

      <blockquote><p>“We need to find a path between the ballot box and the brick.”</blockquote>

      <h3>Stasi: Godwin for mass surveillance</h3>

      <p><a href='https://youtu.be/l8Q0Mme33bM'>Cory Doctorow gave a very interesting talk</a> pointing out how the NSA, and other countries’ government agencies are actually far more able and effective than the Stasi. Technology amplify spying to such a degree, that corrupt elites can retain power and needn’t even promise to do good for their citizens and users.</p>

      <h3>Fireside chat with Peter Sunde</h3>

      <p>On Wednesday afternoon, Peter Sunde, a co-founder and ex-spokesperson for The Pirate Bay, and member of the Pirate Party of Finland, <a href='https://youtu.be/ojiBJs9GyH8'>was interviewed by Geraldine de Bastion</a> about </p>
