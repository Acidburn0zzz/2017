      <h2>Moving forward</h2>

      <p>In <a href='../focus/'>my last update</a>, I mentioned that <a href='https://aralbalkan.com/notes/on-iteration/'>we are taking steps</a> to focus Ind.ie’s <a href='/fund'>limited</a> <a href='/team'>resources</a> on <a href='/'>a single product</a> and <a href='ttps://aralbalkan.com/notes/apple-vs-google-on-privacy-a-tale-of-absolute-competitive-advantage/'>a single platform</a>. The platform we chose provides us with a unique combination of a wide consumer audience coupled with <a href='https://aralbalkan.com/notes/apple-vs-google-on-privacy-a-tale-of-absolute-competitive-advantage/'>a business model that is not spyware</a>.</p>

      <p>We knew this would not please everyone. We refunded the donations of anyone who was upset and asked for one (and we’re happy to do so for as long as Stripe’s systems allow us to).  At the same time, however, donations have also continued to roll in following the announcement so things balanced out quickly.</p>

      <p>And then, unfortunately, there was <a href='http://aaronparecki.com/collections/2015/01/13/1/indie'>the really nasty stuff</a>.</p>

      <p>It was sad to see the vitriolic fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that some people tried to sow following the announcement. <a href='https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/554953047072190464'>One Google employee</a> went so far as to suggest that my previous post was using the Paris attacks “as an excuse”.</p>

      <p>Needless to say, that is a hugely hurtful remark to read.</p>

      <p>I’m not even sure how to respond to such an outlandish and cynical, if not outright slanderous claim. And I don’t need to. Because you wonderful people have already done so for me:</p>

      <blockquote>“I just read your mail. Thanks a lot for your support. Your mission is humanist, to provide the people with a true freedom of speech and privacy
on the Web, which I believe, like you, will be of major importance in the near future. Your pain is mine, ours, and your kind words are heart warming.” – Adrien Luxey (from France, via email)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“I’m so proud of you. From France, I just want to say thank you. For everything, your work and what you said about freedom.” – Valentin Baraise</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“Your letter hit me deeply. Thanks for keepin it Real” – <a href='https://twitter.com/FlyDuoATL/status/554734326126870529'>Reuben</a></blockquote>

      <blockquote>“[N]ice to read your newsletter on this special day after. Thanks &amp; Cheers, from Paris.” – <a href='https://twitter.com/GhitaBO/status/554741087253041152'>Ghita</a></blockquote>

      <blockquote>“I hope most of us donated because we believe in your vision. Freedom and focus are the way to deliver it” – <a href='https://twitter.com/g_r_richardson/status/555073628128428032'>George Richardson</a></blockquote>

      <blockquote>“I think I’m going to pay more attention to your indie project now” – <a href='https://twitter.com/kevinklinkmuler/status/554958450921586688'>Kevin Linkmuler</a></blockquote>

      <p>I just want to take a moment to thank you all for your many lovely messages of support following the announcement – both publicly on Twitter and privately, over email. They give me hope that you understand that we’re not some corporate entity with dastardly intentions and a public relations department but that we are four human beings, like you, who care about the world, who get affected by the events around us, and who are working in the best way we can to make things better.</p>

      <p>Needless to say, none of the slanderous attacks will keep us <a href='/the-camera-panopticon'>from vocally challenging corporate surveillance</a> or the powers that be.

      <p>So we made a difficult decision and now we are moving forward. It’s now time to look at some of the new things happening at Ind.ie this week.</p>

      <h2>Ind.ie Labs</h2>

      </figure>

      <p>We have just released an update to Ind.ie Labs, making it the central location for all things developer-focussed at Ind.ie. <a href='https://labs.ind.ie'>In the Labs</a>, you can find <a href='https://source.ind.ie/project/video-player/tree/master'>Universal Player</a>, our new accessible and responsive HTML5 video player</a>, <a href='http://set.labs.ind.ie'>Set</a>, my unobtrusive and DRY template engine for Node.js and browsers, <a href='https://source.ind.ie/project/responsive-pixels/tree/master'>Responsive Pixels</a>, a <a href='https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/'>Stylus</a> library that lets you think in pixels and deploy in rems with pixel fallbacks, as well as <a href='https://source.ind.ie/project/phoenix/tree/master'>Phoenix</a>, and <a href='https://source.ind.ie/project/pulse/tree/master'>Pulse</a>, which you are familiar with from before.</p>

      <p>And, we have some news on the Pulse side of things.</p>

      <h2>Pulse Swift</h2>

      <figure>

        <figcaption style='text-align:center; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;'><a href='https://source.ind.ie/project/pulse-swift/tree/master'>Pulse</a> lets you synchronise files between devices.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>We have <a href='https://source.ind.ie/project/pulse-swift/tree/master'>a fledgling new Pulse</a> in town.</p>

      <p>Mark Spanbroek and Stefan van den Oord have joined our <a href='https://ind.ie/team'>our extended family</a> and are working on <a href='https://source.ind.ie/project/pulse-swift/tree/master'>a Swift port of Pulse</a> in their spare time. Folks, it’s wonderful to have you on board. I know it’s early days yet, but I have high hopes for Pulse Swift and what it will mean for the future of Heartbeat.</p>

      <p>Until Pulse Swift is ready, we will be continuing to use <a href='https://source.ind.ie/project/pulse/tree/master'>the Go version of Pulse</a>, which, as I mentioned last week, we will no longer be supporting as a separate end-user product.</p>

      <p>That’s not to say we won’t continue developing it, of course.</p>

      <p>Pulse is a core component of Heartbeat, and we are in the process of streamlining it for that very purpose. It goes without saying that other developers might find it useful for their projects and we will be supporting Pulse as a developer-facing component.</p>

      <p>Finally, we’ve <a href='https://source.ind.ie/project/pulse/tree/master'>re-forked Pulse from the last MIT-licensed version of Syncthing</a> so that, going forward, we can have full control over our codebase and, almost as importantly, publish Heartbeat on the App Store.</p>

      <p style='font-style: italic;'>(I’ll write more about the zany world of licenses and contributor agreements in the future but, suffice to say, they are an important design decision. It was one that I initially got wrong with Pulse but we have now put it right. Going forward, just like in our other core projects, we will be releasing any improvements we make to Pulse under a free – as in freedom – license.)</p>

      <h2>Onwards and upwards</h2>

      <p>Well this has been a long update but I feel that it was necessary. I’m hugely excited about welcoming Mark and Stefan to our extended family and very excited about the positive affect Pulse Swift will have on the user experience of Heartbeat. I also hope that the designers and developers among you will enjoy the projects we have shared on Ind.ie Labs and we look forward to your contributions. Running our own Gitlab instance means that we are not as flexible as Github for collaboration but we want to improve that going forward. I’d like to see us strike a balance between not becoming Github and yet facilitating contributions to the developer projects.</p>

      <p>Now, I’m going back to hacking on Heartbeat. There’s still a lot to be done before the pre-alpha but it’s coming along, one line of code at a time.</p>

      <p>Thank you again for being part of our journey.</p>

      <p>Here’s to brighter tomorrows.</p>

      <p>Love,<br><img style='width: 132px' src='images/aral-signature.png'></p>
