          <p>“Someone who knows things about us has some measure of control over us, and someone who knows everything about us has a lot of control over us. Surveillance facilitates control.” <em>By Bruce Schneier on arstechnica, an excerpt from his book ‘Data and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World’</em>.</p>

          <p>“DatenKraken, a term courtesy of Germany, is used to describe large ‘Surveillance Valley’ corporations that terrorise the ocean of information on the internet. Large corporations such as Google, Facebook and Amazon have wrapped their tentacles around the world, extracting private data from where they land and appropriating all its value for their own coffers.” <em>By Ben Rossi and our friend Rafael Laguna on Information Age</em>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class='link-title'><a href='http://newenglanddesk.co/archives/google-is-the-new-status-quo-in-schools/'>Google Is the New Status Quo in Schools</a></strong>
          <p>“If you’re inclined to feel that fast food companies without regard for public health have no place in our public schools, it follows that a corporation whose primary mission is selling personalized advertising based on aggregate data has no business playing a central role in our children’s learning.” <em>By Mark Reeves on The New England Desk Company</em>.</p>

          <p>“But once insurance companies start subsidizing connected devices, what claim will they have on the data those devices generate? Connected smoke detectors can offer not just low battery warnings or smoke alarm notifications, but can share details about people in the home or even temperature data.” <em>By Stacey Higginbotham on Gigaom</em>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class='link-title'><a href='http://surveillancevalley.net/'>Surveillance Valley - The Rise of the Google-Military Complex </a></strong>
          <p>“A book by Yasha Levine that tells the story of how Silicon Valley turned the Internet into the greatest surveillance apparatus in the history of mankind — an apparatus that's increasingly being used not just to monitor us, but to control our lives.” A book well-worth supporting on Kickstarter.</p>

          <p>“The irony is, of course, that while commerce rails against government intervention in one form (privacy-protecting regulation) on the grounds that it inhibits economic activity, some commercial interests have also actively colluded with government intervention in another form (massive surveillance), only to find that that threatens the use of online services in all kinds of damaging ways.” <em>By Robin Wilton (from 2013)</em>.</p>

          <p>“A report commissioned by the Belgian privacy commission has found that Facebook is acting in violation of European law, despite updating its privacy policy.” <em>By Samuel Gibbs on The Guardian</em>.</p>

          <p>“That's a huge problem for the tech economy. According to the industry group Code.org, computing jobs will more than double by 2020, to 1.4 million. If women continue to leave the field, an already dire shortage of qualified tech workers will grow worse.” <em>By Tracey Lien on the LA Times.</em></p>
