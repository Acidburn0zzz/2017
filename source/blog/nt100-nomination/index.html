      <p>Nominations for the Nominet Trust NT100 are open for one more day. The lovely folk at Creative Bloq highlighted ind.ie as one of the most interesting contenders in their post, <a href='http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/whats-your-favourite-social-tech-project-91413035'>What's your favourite social tech project?</a></p>
      <p><a href='http://socialtech.org.uk/nominet-trust-100/'>The Nominet Trust 100</a> celebrates the people and organisations who are using digital technology to change the world for the better, describing ind.ie/phone as “a genuine alternative to existing hardware, software and services whose business models rest on the assumption that it is acceptable to profit by mining your subscribers’ personal data.”</p>
      <p>The Nominet Trust have highlighted ind.ie with a ‘blue tile’, as a project “we are particularly inspired by”. The star badge on the <a href='http://socialtech.org.uk/projects/ind-ie-phone/'>project page</a> signifies ind.ie as ‘one to watch’ in a group of projects that are “inspiring for the possibilities that they offer and the significant potential that their approach creates for transforming social challenges.”</p>
      <p>To show your support for ind.ie, you can nominate us via <a href='http://socialtech.org.uk/projects/indiephone/'>the ind.ie/phone page on the Social Tech Guide</a> or via <a href='https://twitter.com/socialtechguide'>Twitter, @socialtechguide</a>, using the hashtag, #nt100. Nominations are open until 26th September. The results will be announced in December 2014.</p>
