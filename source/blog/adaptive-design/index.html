		<p>The <a href='https://ind.ie/about/summit'>Ind.ie Summit web page</a> was recently featured in an article on Digital Arts magazine. In ‘<a href='http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/interactive-design/adaptive-design-what-is-it-why-should-i-be-using-it/'>Adaptive design: what is it and why should I be using it?</a>’, Craig Grannell explored why adaptive design is crucial for crafting a usable, accessible and future-proof web experience.</p>
		<p>Craig spoke to a few designers and developers, including Aaron Gustafson, Kelly McCarthy, Brad Frost and me. I gave some insight into my ideas behind the design and the development of the Ind.ie Summit page, and how web fonts used with adaptive design were integral to the concept.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>For ind.ie/summit/, we wanted a site with impact that didn’t resemble standard conference fare. We aimed for a style reminiscent of historical bills of rights, but brought up to date and in keeping with our ind.ie brand. With ind.ie being a progressive company, it was important the site was accessible on as many platforms, connection types and viewport sizes as possible.</p>
