            <p>“It’s becoming more and more common for everyday appliances to have features we don't expect, and the implications for privacy and freedom can be surprisingly profound. We should be sure we know what we’re buying into.” <em>By Ian Steadman on the New Statesman.</em></p>

            <p>“Compared with what’s already happening, Samsung’s warning not to discuss sensitive issues in front of its TVs seems pretty tame. But you can fight back.” <em>By Alex Hern in The Guardian.</em></p>

            <p>“The world has gone nuts today, over a story that says Samsung is spying on us in our living rooms via its Smart TV software. Lines have been drawn between a scary caveat in a privacy policy and George Orwell’s 1984, and we’re being warned about how we’re losing ourselves to technology all over again. Don’t be foolish, guys: your privacy vanished a long time ago.” <em>By Luke Hopewell on Gizmodo.</em></p>

            <p>“A year ago, the largest video site on the net ditching Flash would have been a blow for Internet freedom. Today, it's a bitter reminder of how the three big commercial browser vendors—Apple, Microsoft and Google—Netflix, the BBC, and the World Wide Web Consortium sold the whole Internet out.” <em>By Cory Doctorow on EFF.</em></p>

            <p>The signatories of this declaration call upon nation states to take action. Intelligence agencies must be subjected to transparency and accountability.
