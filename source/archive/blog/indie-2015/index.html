  		<p>2014 was a huge year for us.</p>

      <p><a href='/supporters'>Over 1,500 of you</a> showed your support for <a href='/manifesto'>independent technology</a> and helped us to raise <a href='/fund'>more than $110,000 in crowdfunding</a>.</p>

      <p>Thanks to your support, <a href='/about/team'>we are now four full time people at Ind.ie</a> and our extended family continues to grow.</p>

      <p>All my effort is currently focussed on coding <a href='/heartbeat'>Heartbeat</a> and <a href='/waystone'>Waystone</a> for the pre-alpha that is scheduled to begin this month, so I must apologise if I’m hard to reach or slow to respond to private correspondence this month. George is supporting me on the <a href='/pulse'>Pulse</a> side of things, while Laura has been doing some amazing work on our website that you’ll be hearing about soon. Alongside all this, <a href='mailto:jo@ind.ie' title='Email Jo'>Jo</a>, our head of operations, keeps Ind.ie running from one day to the next (and if you have any pressing questions or need to reach someone urgently, she’s your best bet.)</p>

      <p>We’re hugely excited for 2015.</p>

      <p>This is the year that we plant the seeds of the Indienet.</p>

      <p>It’s early days and yet, with your support, we’re making a beginning.</p>

      <p>Here’s to making 2015 a happier new year together.</p>
