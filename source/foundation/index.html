		<h1>Foundation</h1>
		<p>We want to support individuals and organisations that have adopted the <a href='/about/manifesto'>ind.ie manifesto</a> and are working to create indie products. We also want to raise awareness about our social mission, to run educational campaigns, and to be a resource and voice to lead the conversation on the impact of technology on privacy, civil liberties, and democracy. We believe that a foundation is the best way to do this and we are in the exploratory stages of this initiative.</p>
		<p>The aim of the ind.ie Foundation will be to support ind.ie phone as well as other indie initiatives.</p>
		<p>If you have experience in this area and want to help out, please get in touch with us.</p>
